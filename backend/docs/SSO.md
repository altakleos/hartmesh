# SSO / OIDC Authentication

DeerFlow supports single sign-on (SSO) via any OpenID Connect (OIDC) 2.0 compliant provider. This includes Keycloak, Google Workspace, Azure AD, Okta, and many others.

## Architecture

The OIDC flow uses the **Authorization Code flow** with PKCE (S256) and nonce validation for defense in depth:

```

**Key design decisions:**

- **State via signed cookie** — No server-side session store or Redis needed. The OIDC state (provider, nonce, code_verifier, next path) is signed with the JWT secret and stored in an HttpOnly cookie.
- **PKCE + nonce enabled by default** — Even though confidential clients could use `client_secret`, PKCE provides an extra layer of security.
- **No email auto-linking** — a pre-existing local (email/password) account is never auto-linked to an SSO identity. If the IdP-reported email collides with an existing local account, the SSO login is blocked with a 409 so an SSO login can never seize a password account.
- **An unusable address is its own refusal** — the IdP-reported email becomes the account's address, and the account record holds only an address that parses as one (a special-use or single-label domain is refused; no name is looked up, so a plausible domain is held whether or not mail reaches it). An address it refuses blocks the login with `sso_email_unusable` and creates nothing; it is never reported as a collision with an account, because there is none to collide with.
- **The address follows the sign-in** — the subject is the identity; the email is an attribute of it. An existing account takes the address its token carries at every sign-in, unless the token carries none, it is unverified where verification is required, its domain is one `allowed_email_domains` does not allow, no account record could hold it, or another account already holds it. Each of those leaves the stored address alone and still signs the person in. Where no role mapping is configured, `admin_emails` is read from the address the sign-in settles on — which is why the domain rule has to hold here too, or an address a new subject may not have would be one an existing subject could acquire, and acquiring an `admin_emails` address would be a promotion.
- **An address another account holds** — a new identity is never given an existing account, and what the person is told depends on the door the holder has. An account with a password is theirs to sign in with (409, `sso_account_exists`); one without is not, and answers `sso_email_taken` — a deliberately different sentence, because the remedies are opposite. The deployer releases a turned-off account's address with `python -m app.gateway.auth.accounts release-email`, which records what it held in `users.email_released_from`; a later sign-in that writes an address clears that column, so an account holding a real address again can be released again.
- **A clock tolerance, bounded** — the ID token's `iat`, `nbf` and `exp` are validated with
  `auth.oidc.clock_skew_leeway_seconds` (default 60, range 0–300). The product used to allow no
  tolerance at all, so a Gateway whose clock had fallen a second or two behind the provider —
  the ordinary state of a VM between NTP polls, and of any guest just resumed from a hypervisor
  snapshot — refused every sign-in by everyone with nothing on the page but `sso_failed`. It is
  one number for the deployment rather than one per provider, because it describes this host's
  clock and not any provider's. Outside the tolerance the token is still refused, and the
  refusal logs how far the token's timestamps sit from this Gateway's clock, so an operator can
  tell a clock that needs NTP from a token that needs refusing.
- **Existing DeerFlow JWT** — After successful OIDC authentication, DeerFlow creates its own JWT session cookie. The OIDC provider's tokens are never exposed to the browser.

## Configuration

### Step 1: Enable OIDC in `config.yaml`

```yaml
auth:
  oidc:
    enabled: true
    frontend_base_url: http://localhost:3000
    # Optional: how far this Gateway's clock may disagree with the provider's
    # on the ID token's timestamps. Default 60 seconds, range 0-300.
    clock_skew_leeway_seconds: 60
    providers:
      keycloak:
        display_name: Keycloak
        issuer: http://localhost:8080/realms/deerflow
        client_id: deerflow
        client_secret: $KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET
        redirect_uri: http://localhost:8001/api/v1/auth/callback/keycloak
        scopes:
          - openid
          - email
          - profile
```

### Step 2: Set the client secret as an environment variable

```bash
export KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

Or create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

### Step 3: Restart the backend

```bash
cd backend && make dev
```

## Provider Configuration

### Per-Provider Options

```yaml
providers:
  <provider-id>:
    display_name: "Display Name"    # Shown on the SSO button
    issuer: "https://..."           # OIDC issuer URL (must match the provider's .well-known/openid-configuration)
    client_id: "..."                # OAuth2 client ID
    client_secret: $SECRET          # OAuth2 client secret (supports $ENV_VAR)
    redirect_uri: "..."             # Optional: explicit callback URL
    scopes:                         # Default: ["openid", "email", "profile"]
      - openid
      - email
    token_endpoint_auth_method: "client_secret_post"  # client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, or none

    # User provisioning
    auto_create_users: true         # Auto-create DeerFlow account on first SSO login (default: true)
    require_verified_email: true    # Reject logins without verified email (default: true)
    allowed_email_domains: []       # Restrict to specific domains (default: no restriction)
    admin_emails: []                # Auto-grant admin role to these emails (default: none)

    # Security features (both enabled by default)
    pkce_enabled: true
    nonce_enabled: true

    # Endpoint overrides (optional)
    # Use if the provider has non-standard endpoints.
    # authorization_endpoint: "https://..."
    # token_endpoint: "https://..."
    # userinfo_endpoint: "https://..."
    # jwks_uri: "https://..."
```

### Endpoint Overrides

Some providers don't return all endpoints from their `.well-known/openid-configuration`. You can override specific endpoints:

```yaml
providers:
  my-provider:
    display_name: "My Provider"
    issuer: "https://provider.example.com"
    client_id: "..."
    client_secret: $SECRET
    authorization_endpoint: "https://provider.example.com/oauth2/authorize"
    token_endpoint: "https://provider.example.com/oauth2/token"
    userinfo_endpoint: "https://provider.example.com/oauth2/userinfo"
    jwks_uri: "https://provider.example.com/oauth2/jwks"
```

## Local Keycloak Example

This section walks through setting up a local Keycloak instance with Podman or Docker for development.

### 1. Start Keycloak

```bash
# Using Podman
podman run -d \
  --name keycloak \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1 \
  start-dev

# Using Docker
docker run -d \
  --name keycloak \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1 \
  start-dev
```

### 2. Create a Realm and Client

1. Open the Keycloak admin console: http://localhost:8080
2. Log in with `admin` / `admin`
3. Create a new realm called `deerflow`
4. In the `deerflow` realm, go to **Clients** → **Create client**
5. Configure:
   - **Client ID**: `deerflow`
   - **Client authentication**: On (makes it a confidential client)
   - **Standard flow**: Enabled
   - **Valid redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/auth/callback/keycloak`
   - **Valid post logout redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:3000/*`
   - **Web origins**: `http://localhost:8001` (or `+` to allow all redirect URI origins)
6. After creating the client, go to the **Credentials** tab
7. Copy the **Client secret** — this is your `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`

### 3. Create a Test User

1. In the `deerflow` realm, go to **Users** → **Add user**
2. Set **Username**: `testuser`
3. Set **Email**: `testuser@example.com`
4. Set **Email verified**: On
5. Go to the **Credentials** tab
6. Set a password (e.g. `testpass123`)
7. Set **Temporary**: Off

### 4. Configure DeerFlow

Add to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  oidc:
    enabled: true
    frontend_base_url: http://localhost:3000
    providers:
      keycloak:
        display_name: Keycloak
        issuer: http://localhost:8080/realms/deerflow
        client_id: deerflow
        client_secret: $KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET
        redirect_uri: http://localhost:8001/api/v1/auth/callback/keycloak
        scopes:
          - openid
          - email
          - profile
```

Set the secret:

```bash
export KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET="the-secret-from-step-2"
```

### 5. Restart and Test

```bash
cd backend && make dev
```

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. On the login page, click **Login with Keycloak**
3. You'll be redirected to Keycloak's login page
4. Log in with `testuser` / `testpass123`
5. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to the DeerFlow workspace

## Account Settings for SSO Users

When a user logs in via SSO, the account settings page detects this (via the `oauth_provider` field returned by `/api/v1/auth/me`) and:

- Displays the SSO provider name (e.g. "Keycloak") in the profile section
- Replaces the password change form with an informational message
- Password changes must be done through the SSO provider, not DeerFlow

The backend also rejects password change requests for OAuth users:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid_credentials",
  "message": "OAuth users cannot change password"
}
```

## Public API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/auth/providers` | Returns list of enabled SSO providers (safe metadata only) |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/oauth/{provider}` | Initiates SSO login, redirects to the OIDC provider |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/callback/{provider}` | OIDC callback — exchanges code, creates session, redirects to frontend |

## Frontend Callback Flow

The frontend handles the post-SSO flow at `/auth/callback`:

1. After the backend processes the OIDC callback and sets cookies, it redirects to `{frontend_base_url}/auth/callback?next=...`
2. The callback page calls `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
3. On success: redirects to the workspace (or the original `next` path)
4. On failure: redirects to `/login?error=sso_failed`

## Security Notes

- **State cookies** are HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Max-Age=300 seconds, and signed with the JWT secret
- **PKCE** prevents authorization code interception attacks
- **Nonce** prevents ID token replay attacks
- **UserInfo sub check** ensures the UserInfo response matches the ID token subject
- **Reject alg=none** — ID tokens with algorithm "none" are always rejected
- **No email auto-linking** — SSO accounts are always separate from email/password accounts. An email collision with an existing local account blocks the SSO login (409) rather than merging the two.
- **Verified email requirement** — SSO users must have verified emails by default
- **Bounded clock tolerance** — ID token timestamps are validated with
  `auth.oidc.clock_skew_leeway_seconds` (default 60, max 300). Enough for a VM between NTP
  polls, far short of accepting a token that has genuinely expired. Set it to `0` to restore
  the previous behaviour of allowing no skew at all.
